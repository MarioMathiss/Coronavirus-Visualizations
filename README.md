# Coronavirus-Visualizations
Data visualizations using Plotly and data from Our World in Data &amp; John Hopkins University.
## Data Files Used for Visualizations:

To get daily coronavirus data from JHU GitHub page we will use the JHU_covid_scrape.py file.
This data contains high level of granularity on US covid data, includes data by county in the United States.

### Our World in Data: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data
To get daily coronavirus data from OWID GitHub page we will use the OWID_covid_scrape.py file.
